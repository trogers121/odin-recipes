    <h1>Chicken Ramen</h1>

    <p>Making real-deal ramen is a lengthy project that requires planning in advance. But there are days when you just want a delicious bowl of it, without the fuss. This easy Korean-style kimchi ramen is for those times. It's loaded with flavor, but takes less than an hour to throw together, thanks to several umami-rich ingredients and a cool baking-soda trick that turns angel-hair pasta into ramen-like noodles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons canola, vegetable, or other neutral oil, divided</li>
      <li>8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps sliced</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely diced</li>
      <li>1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and minced</li>
      <li>5 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 5 teaspoons)</li>
      <li>3 quarts gelatinous chicken stock (see note)</li>
      <li>1 packed cup kimchi, chopped, plus 6 tablespoons kimchi liquid</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons miso</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons baking soda (if using angel hair pasta)</li>
      <li>1 (500-gram) box angel hair pasta or 4 servings ramen-style noodles</li>
      <li>4 soft-boiled eggs, halved, for serving</li>
      <li>2 scallions, white and light green parts only, very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Nori (Japanese seaweed sheets), for serving</li>
      <li>Watercress or other tender leafy green, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shiitake, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have released their water and are starting to brown all over, about 4 minutes. Transfer shiitake to a plate and keep warm.</li>

      <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to saucepan, then add onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook, stirring up any brown bits on bottom of saucepan, until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>

      <li>Add stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in kimchi and its liquid, miso, and soy sauce and return to a simmer. Season with salt, if needed.</li>

      <li>Meanwhile, if using angel-hair pasta, add baking soda to 4 quarts of boiling salted water; otherwise, omit baking soda and bring 4 quarts of plain salted water to a boil. Cook noodles until al dente; drain completely.</li>

      <li>Transfer noodles to bowl and spoon kimchi broth on top. Top each bowl with 2 egg halves, reserved shiitakes, scallions, nori, and watercress. Serve right away.</li>
    </ol>
